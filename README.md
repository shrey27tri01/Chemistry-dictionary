# Chemistry Dictionary
This program is designed to provide students with a ready-made compilation of notes and important terms and definitions related to their chemistry curriculum of class 11. This is a project I did in my Computer Science course in class 12th.

## Tools, Facilities and Benefits offered :
To the beginners, this software can be very useful as it contains almost all the important terms about the topics they will be going to encounter during their one year journey. This may also help them during their revision time. Apart from the normal definitions, students can also search their history and add new topics on their own.

## Places where it can be used : 
This software can be used in schools, tuitions as well as in homes by the students during their their revision time or at the begginning of their academic session.
