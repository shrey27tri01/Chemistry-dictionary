                                                          CHARGE TO MASS RATIO OF ELEMENT

In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson
measur
ed the ratio of electrical char
ge (
e
) to
the mass of electr
on (
m
e 
) by using cathode
ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic
field perpendicular to each other as well as to
the path of electr
ons. Thomson
argued that the amount of deviation of the
particles from their path in the pr
esence of
electrical or magnetic field depends upon:
the magnitude of the negative char
ge on
the particle,the mas
s of the particle , and the str
ength of the electrical or magnetic
field .
