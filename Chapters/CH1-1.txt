                                                              IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY
Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition, properties and interaction of matter.
Chemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science like 
physics, biology, geology etc. Chemistry also plays an important role in daily life.
Chemical principles are important in diverse areas, such as: weather patterns, functioning of brain 
and operation of a computer.
Chemical industries manufacturing fertilizers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, 
detergents, metals, alloys and other inorganic and organic chemicals, including new materials, 
contribute in a big way to the national economy.

------ However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the 
chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases like methane, carbon dioxide 
etc.Understanding of bio-chemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals 
and synthesis of new exotic materials are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation 
of chemists.
