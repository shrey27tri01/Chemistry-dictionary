PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE s-BLOCK ELEMENTS

The s-Block of the periodic table constitutes Group1 (alkali metals) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals). They are so called because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature. The alkali metals are characterised by one
 s-electron and the alkaline earth metals by two s-electrons in the valence shell of their atoms. These are highly reactive metals forming monopositive (M + ) and dipositve (M2+) ions respectively.
  There is a regular trend in the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metal with increasing atomic numbers. The atomic and ionic sizes increase and the ionization enthalpies decrease systematically down the group.
 Somewhat similar trends are observed among the properties of the alkaline earth metals.   The first element in each of these groups, lithium in Group 1 and beryllium in Group 2 shows similarities in properties to the second 
member of the next group. Such similarities are termed as the ‘diagonal relationship’ in the periodic table. As such these elements are anomalous as far as their group characteristics are concerned.
