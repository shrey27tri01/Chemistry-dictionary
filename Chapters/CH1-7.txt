 LAWS OF CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS

The combination of elements to form compounds is governed by the following four basic laws.

1. Law of Conservation of Mass : It states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed.This law was put forth by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. 
    
2. Law of Definite Proportions : This law was given by, a French chemist, Joseph Proust. He stated that a given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by weight.It is sometimes also referred to as Law of Definite Composition.

3. Law of Multiple Proportions : This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803.According to this law, if two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element, are in the ratio of small whole numbers.

4. Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volume : This law was proposed by french chemist Joseph Louis Gay Lussac(1778-1850).This law states that when gases react together to form other gases, the ratio between the volumes of the reactant gases and the gaseous products can be expressed in simple whole numbers.
