THE CARBON FAMILY
Carbon is a typical non-metal forming covalent bonds employing all its four valence electrons (2s22p2). It shows the property of 
catenation, the ability to form chains or rings, not only with C–C single bonds but also with multiple bonds (C=C or C=C). The tendency to catenation decreases as C>>Si>Ge ~ Sn > Pb. Carbon provides one of the best examples of
 allotropy. Three important allotropes of carbon are diamond, graphite and fullerenes. The members of the carbon family mainly exhibit +4 and +2 oxidation states; compouds in +4 oxidation states are generally covalent in
 nature. The tendency to show +2 oxidation state increases among heavier elements. Lead in +2 state is stable whereas in +4 oxidation state it is a strong oxidising agent. Carbon also exhibits negative oxidation states. It forms
 two important oxides: CO and CO2. Carbon monoxide is neutral whereas CO2 is acidic in nature. Carbon monoxide having lone pair of electrons on C forms metal carbonyls. It is deadly poisonous due to higher stability of its
 haemoglobin complex as compared to that of oxyhaemoglobin complex. Carbon dioxide as such  is not toxic. However, increased content of CO2 in atmosphere due to combustion of fossil fuels and decomposition of limestone
 is feared to cause increase in ‘green house effect’. This, in turn, raises the temperature of the atmosphere and causes serious complications. Silica, silicates and silicones are important class of compounds and find applications in
 industry and technology.
