Two different systems of measurement, i.e.
the 
English System 
and the 
Metric System
were being used in different parts of the world.
The metric system which originated in France
in late eighteenth century, was more
convenient as it was based on the decimal
system. The need of a common standard
system was being felt by the scientific
community. Such a system was established
in 1960 and is discussed below in detail.
