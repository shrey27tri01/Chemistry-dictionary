VALENCE BOND THEORY
The valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent. Basically the VB 
theory discusses bond formation  in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example the formation of the H2 molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is
 seen that the potential energy of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring the nuclei
 still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases which helps in bringing them closer. It is however
 seen that the actual bond enthalpy and bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken into account. For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling 
introduced the concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp,sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals of  Be, B,C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules like BeCl2, BCl3, CH4, NH3 and
 H2O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in molecules like C2H2 and C2H4.
