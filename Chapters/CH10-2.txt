THE ALKALI METALS
  The alkali metals are silvery
 white, soft and low melting. They are highly reactive. The compounds of alkali metals are predominantly ionic.Their oxides and hydroxides are soluble in water forming strong alkalies. Important compounds of sodium includes
 sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogencarbonate. Sodium hydroxide is manufactured by Castner-Kellner process and sodium carbonate by Solvay process.
