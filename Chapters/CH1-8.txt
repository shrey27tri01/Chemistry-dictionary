A word mole(means heap or pile) was introduced Avagadro and is defined as the amount of substance 
that contans as many entites(atoms molecules or other particles) as there are atoms in exactly 0.012kg
(or 12g) of the carbon-12 isotope.

By using mass spectometer it has been found that ther are 6.023×10^23 atoms present in 12g of C-12 isotope. 
 MOLAR MASS
The mass of one mole of a substance in grams is called its molar mass.
The molar mass in grams is numerically equal to atomic/molecular/ formula mass in u.
