THE ALKALINE EARTH METALS
 The chemistry of alkaline earth
 metals is very much like that of the alkali metals. However, some differences arise because of reduced atomic and ionic sizes and increased cationic charges in case of alkaline earth metals. Their oxides and hydroxides are less
 basic than the alkali metal oxides and hydroxides. Industrially important compounds of calcium include calcium oxide (lime), calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), calcium sulphate (Plaster of Paris), calcium carbonate (limestone) 
and cement. Portland cement is an important constructional material. It is manufactured by heating a pulverised mixture of limestone and clay in a rotary kiln. The clinker thus obtained is mixed with some gypsum (2-3%) to give
 a fine powder of cement. All these substances find variety of uses in different areas.   Monovalent sodium and potassium ions and divalent magnesium and calcium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These 
ions  perform important biological functions such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction.
