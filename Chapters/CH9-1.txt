HYDROGEN - INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen is the lightest atom with only one electron. Loss of this electron results in an elementary particle, the proton. Thus, it is unique in character. It has three isotopes, namely : protium (1 1 H), deuterium (D or 2 1H)  and 
tritium (T or3 1H). Amongst these three, only tritium is radioactive. Inspite of its resemblance both with alkali metals and halogens, it occupies a separate position in the periodic table because of its unique properties. Hydrogen
 is the most abundant element in the universe. In the free state it is almost not found in the earth’s atmosphere. However, in the combined state, it is the third most abundant element on the earth’s surface.
