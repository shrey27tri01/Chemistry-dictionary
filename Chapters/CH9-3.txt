WATER AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
 Water is the most common and abundantly available substance. It is of a great 
chemical and biological significance. The ease with which water is transformed from liquid to solid and to gaseous state allows it to play a vital role in the biosphere. The water molecule is highly polar in nature due to its bent
 structure. This property leads to hydrogen bonding which is the maximum in ice and least in water vapour. The polar nature of water makes it: (a) a very good solvent for ionic and partially ionic compounds; (b) to act as an 
amphoteric (acid as well as base) substance; and (c) to form hydrates of different types. Its property to dissolve many salts, particularly in large quantity, makes it hard and hazardous for industrial use. Both temporary and
 permanent hardness can be removed by the use of zeolites, and synthetic ion-exchangers. Heavy water, D2O is another important compound which is manufactured by the electrolytic enrichment of normal water. It is 
essentially used as a moderator in nuclear reactors. Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 has an interesting non-polar structure and is widely used as an industrial bleach and in pharmaceutical and pollution control treatment of industrial 
and domestic effluents.
