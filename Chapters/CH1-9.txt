                                                                     PERCENTAGE COMPOSITION

Percentage Composition is the composition of various elements in a compound containing two or more elements.

Let us understand it by taking the example
of water . Since water contains hydrogenand oxygen, the percentage composition of both
these elements can be calculated as follows :

Mass % of an element = mass of that element in the compound × 100 molar mass of the compound
Molar mass of water
= 18.02 g
Mass % of hydrogen
= 2×1.008×100/18.02
= 11.18
Mass % of oxygen
= 16.00×100 /18.02
= 88.79
