ALKANES , ALKENES AND ALKYNES
 The important reactions of alkanes are
 free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo 
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under special conditions. Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma bonds. Out of staggered and the 
eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical (cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double
 bond. Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character.
