CONTROLLING POLLUTION
 Strategies for controlling environmental pollution can be: (i) waste management i.e., reduction of the waste and proper 
disposal, also recycling of materials and energy, (ii) adopting methods in day-to-day life, which results in the reduction of environmental pollution. The second method is a new branch of chemistry, which is in its infancy known
 as green chemistry. It utilizes the existing knowledge and practices so as to bring about reduction in the production of pollutants.
