Anything which has mass and occupies space is called matter.In solids, these particles are held very close to each other in an orderly fashion and there is not much 
freedom of movement. In liquids, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. 
However, in gases, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states 
and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of
matter exhibit the following characteristics:
(i) Solids have definite volume and definite shape.
(ii) Liquids have definite volume but not the definite shape. 
(iii) Gases have neither definite volume nor definite shape.
