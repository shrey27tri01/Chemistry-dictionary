                                                             DALTON'S ATOMIC THEORY

In 1808, Dalton published ‘A New System of Chemical Philosophy’ in which he proposed
the following :
1. Matter consists of indivisible atoms.
2. All the atoms of a given element have identical properties including identical mass.
3. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio.
4. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation of atoms. These are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. 
Dalton’s theory could explain the laws of chemical combination.
