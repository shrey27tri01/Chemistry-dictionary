ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISMS
Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule,
 fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved 
in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage involve 
the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may
 help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities. Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition,
 elimination and rearrangement reactions.
