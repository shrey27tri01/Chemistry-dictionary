                                            ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR MASSES

1. ATOMIC MASS

Atomic mass is defined as a number that expresses as to how many times an atom of the element is 
heavier than 1/12th of the mass of carbon atom(Carbon-12).Therefore,one atomic mass unit is defined as the mass exactly equal to 1/12th of the mass of an atom of 
     carbon(Carbon-12).
           

3. Molecular Mass

Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses
of the elements present in a molecule.
