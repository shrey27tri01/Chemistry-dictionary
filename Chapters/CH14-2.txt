ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION
 Ozone layer is one of the important constituents of stratosphere. Tropospheric pollution is basically due to various oxides of sulphur, nitrogen,
 carbon, halogens and also due to particulate pollutants. The gaseous pollutants come down to the earth in the form of acid rain. 75% of the solar energy reaching earth is absorbed by the earth surface and rest is radiated back 
to the atmosphere. These gases mentioned above trap the heat which result into global warming. It is important to realise that these very gases are also responsible for the life on the earth as they trap the requisite amount of 
solar energy for the sustainance of life. The increase in the greenhouse gases is raising the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere which, if not checked, may eventually result in melting of polar ice caps and consequently may
 submerge the costal land mass. Many human activities are producing chemicals, which are responsible for the depletion of ozone layer in the stratosphere, leading to the formation of ozone hole. Through the ozone hole, 
ultraviolet radiations can penetrate into the earth’s atmosphere causing mutation of genes. Water is the elixir of life but the same water, if polluted by pathogens, organic wastes, toxic heavy metals, pesticides etc., will turn into
 poison. Therefore, one should take care to follow international standards to maintain purity levels of drinking water.  Industrial wastes and excessive use of pesticides, result into pollution of land mass and water bodies. 
Judicious use of chemicals required for agricultural practices can lead to sustainable development.
