STRUCTURE AND NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
 The three dimensional  representation of organic compounds on paper can be drawn by wedge and dash 
formula. Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a unique fashion and which determines 
the physical and  chemical properties of the compounds. The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC
 nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name.
